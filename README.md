# note_it
JavaScript Fundamentals Project

## Project Breakdown

### Objective:
Build a web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes using IndexedDB for client-side storage, web workers for background processing, web components for building custom elements, and async code for handling asynchronous operations.

### Requirements:
The application should have a clean and responsive user interface built with HTML and CSS. 
The user should be able to create a new note by entering a title and text, and then clicking a button or hitting the "Enter" key. 
The user should be able to view a list of all notes, and click on a note to view its details. 
The user should be able to edit an existing note by clicking an "Edit" button, making changes, and then clicking a "Save" button or hitting the "Enter" key. 
The user should be able to delete a note by clicking a "Delete" button. 
All data should be stored in IndexedDB, and web workers should be used to handle any time-consuming operations such as loading or saving data. 
The application should use web components to build custom elements for the note list, and note editor. 
All code should be written in JavaScript, with appropriate use of async/await and Promises to handle asynchronous operations.

The application must be memory efficient and performant. 
The application must support potentially large lists. 
All accessibility markers should be in place.

### Patterns:
You should use the following patterns in your code:

convention over code
factory pattern

### Structure
The following will affect your score. 
Your application and file structure Naming of everything from files to classes and members Loading resources, when you load it and how you load it
